Sender Analysis:

The From address uses alerts@chase.com, impersonating a legitimate financial institution.The Reply-To and Return-Path headers resolve to @proton.me, which is unrelated to Chase Bank.The sending IP (185.70.40.140) is owned by Proton AG (Switzerland), not by Chase Bank infrastructure.SPF authentication passed, but for the ProtonMail domain — not for chase.com.DKIMauthentication failed (timeout), and no aligned DKIM signature exists for chase.com.DMARC technically passes, but alignment is based on ProtonMail’s domain, not the impersonated brand.The Message-ID domain is @protonmail.com, further confirming the email originated from ProtonMail and not Chase.These indicators confirm brand spoofing via a third-party email service.


Verdict
======================================
Confirmed Phishing Email

This email is a phishing attempt impersonating Chase Bank. Despite passing certain authentication checks (SPF/DMARC), the lack of domain alignment, ProtonMail infrastructure usage, mismatched Reply-To address, and social engineering language clearly indicate malicious intent.

Add detection rules for brand impersonation with ProtonMail infrastructure.
